The algorithm should generate an "answer set" that is a set of terms that  have a match under the given relation.





#+begin_src ocaml 
type answerSet = { relation : term -> term -> bool
                 , terms:     [term] }

#+end_src



A term 't' may be added as part of the answer set when it meets the following criteria.
