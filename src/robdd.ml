    (*
 If the label id(lo(n)) is the same as id(hi(n)), then we set id(n) to be that label.
That is because the boolean function represented at n is the same function as the
one represented at lo(n) and hi(n). In other words, node n performs a redundant
test and can be eliminated by reduction C2.
r If there is another node m such that n and m have the same variable x , and
i
id(lo(n)) = id(lo(m)) and id(hi(n)) = id(hi(m)), then we set id(n) to be id(m).
This is because the nodes n and m compute the same boolean function (compare
with reduction C3).
r Otherwise, we set id(n) to the next unused integer label.

    (* 

The reductions C1â€“C3 are at the core of any serious use of OBDDs, for
whenever we construct a BDD we will want to convert it to its reduced form.
In this section, we describe an algorithm reduce which does this efficiently
for ordered BDDs.
If the ordering of B is [x 1 , x 2 , . . . , x l ], then B has at most l + 1 layers. The
algorithm reduce now traverses B layer by layer in a bottom-up fashion,
beginning with the terminal nodes. In traversing B, it assigns an integer
label id(n) to each node n of B, in such a way that the subOBDDs with
root nodes n and m denote the same boolean function if, and only if, id(n)
equals id(m).
Since reduce starts with the layer of terminal nodes, it assigns the first
label (say #0) to the first 0-node it encounters. All other terminal 0-nodes
denote the same function as the first 0-node and therefore get the same label
(compare with reduction C1). Similarly, the 1-nodes all get the next label,
say #1.
Now let us inductively assume that reduce has already assigned integer
labels to all nodes of a layer > i (i.e. all terminal nodes and x j -nodes with
j > i). We describe how nodes of layer i (i.e. x i -nodes) are being handled.

    (* apply a binary function in two arguments to a bdd *) 
    (* From Logic in Computer Science
Given two diagrams B_f and B_g considering nodes r_f and r_g
(0|1) (0|1) case
1. If both r f and r g are terminal nodes with labels l f and l g , respectively (recall
   that terminal labels are either 0 or 1), then we compute the value l f op l g and
   let the resulting OBDD be B 0 if that value is 0 and B 1 otherwise.

X_i X_i case
2. In the remaining cases, at least one of the root nodes is a non-terminal. Suppose
   that both root nodes are x i -nodes. Then we create an x i -node n with a dashed
   line to apply (op, lo(r f ), lo(r g )) and a solid line to apply (op, hi(r f ), hi(r g )), i.e.
   we call apply recursively on the basis of (6.2).

X_i (X_j : j>i | 0 | 1) case
3. If r f is an x i -node, but r g is a terminal node or an x j -node with j > i,
   then we know that there is no x i -node in B g because the two OBDDs have
   a compatible ordering of boolean variables. Thus, g is independent of x i
   (g â‰¡ g[0/x i ] â‰¡ g[1/x i ]). Therefore, we create an x i -node n with a dashed line
   to apply (op, lo(r f ), r g ) and a solid line to apply (op, hi(r f ), r g ).

X_j (X_i : i>j | 0 | 1) case
4. The case in which r g is a non-terminal, but r f is a terminal or an x j -node with
   j > i, is handled symmetrically to case 3.
